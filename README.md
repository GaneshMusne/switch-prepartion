# 🎯 12-Week Job Switch Preparation Plan

## **Week 1-2: Resume + Profile Building + Quick Wins**

### Resume Optimization
**Days 1-3:**

## **Week 1-12: Communication & English (PARALLEL - Daily)**

**This is crucial! Work on this throughout:**

### Daily Practice (30-45 min):

**Week 1-4: Foundation**
- **Speaking practice (15 min):** Talk to yourself in mirror
  - Explain your project
  - Describe your daily work
  - Answer: "Tell me about yourself"
- **Vocabulary (10 min):** Learn 5 technical terms/day with pronunciation
- **Listening (15 min):** Watch tech talks on YouTube (2x speed helps)

**Week 5-8: Technical Communication**
- **Mock interviews (30 min):** Record yourself answering:
  - "Explain Spring Boot to a beginner"
  - "What is dependency injection?"
  - "Describe your microservices architecture"
- Review recordings, identify filler words (um, uh, like)
- Practice speaking slower and clearer

**Week 9-12: Interview Simulation**
- Join English speaking groups (Discord, Meetup)
- Practice with friends/colleagues
- Mock interviews on Pramp (free peer interviews)

### Key Tips:
- **Think in English**: Stop translating from your native language
- **Use simple sentences**: Complex grammar isn't needed
- **Pause, don't fill**: It's okay to take 2-3 seconds to think
- **Structure your answers**: "I'll explain this in 3 parts..."

**STAR Method for Behavioral Questions:**
- **S**ituation: Brief context
- **T**ask: Your responsibility
- **A**ction: What YOU did (use "I", not "we")
- **R**esult: Quantifiable outcome
